Decayed FCPGs
=============

Decayed FCPGs only consider parameter grid values close to the stream channel, i.e. the further a value is away from a stream channel the less important it is. These examples can be tailored to many applications, e.g. the decay distance could be computed from landscape features other than stream channels.
