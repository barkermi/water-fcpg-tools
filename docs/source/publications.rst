Barnhart, T.B., Schultz, A.R., Siefken, S.A., Thompson, F., Welborn, T., 
Sando, T.R., Rea, A.H., McCarthy, P.M., 2021, Flow-Conditioned Parameter 
Grids for the Contiguous United States: A Pilot, Seamless Basin Characteristic 
Dataset: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9HUWM6Q.


Projects
=============

`Flow-Conditioned Parameter Grids | Wyoming-Montana Water Science Center <https://www.usgs.gov/centers/wyoming-montana-water-science-center/science/flow-conditioned-parameter-grids>`_   
* This project works to formalize methods of generating these grids and provides a pilot suite of FCPGs for other projects to experiment with. FCPGs can be used to train and drive statistical, machine learning, and physical hydrologic models.
