   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Flow-Conditioned Parameter Grid Tools's documentation!
=================================================================
A Python library to make flow-conditioned parameter grids (FCPGs) by either HUC2, HUC4, or other geospatial tiling schemes. These tools can be used in a Linux HPC environment or locally on your system. These tools are written for Linux and are tested for Windows 10 using the Window's Subsystem for Linux Ubuntu 18 LTS.

Quick Start
===========
Load the FCPGtools using :code:`import FCPGtools as fcpg`.

Installation
============
Clone the repository using :code:`git clone https://code.usgs.gov/StreamStats/FCPGtools.git`.

Then `cd` into the repository and create a Anaconda environment using the supplied :code:`FCPGtools_env.yml` file by calling :code:`conda env create -f FCPGtools_env.yml`.

Then, install the repository using :code:`pip install git+file:<Full Path to the FCPGtools repository>`

For example, :code:`pip install git+file:/home/<username>/projects/FCPGtools`

On a HPC system you may need to load the correct Python module before building the Anaconda environment. This might be done with :code:`module load python/anaconda3`

Dependencies
============

Dependencies for this work are largely taken care of via the anaconda environment specified by the yml file; however, the tools do rely on [TauDEM 5.3.8](https://github.com/dtarb/TauDEM/tree/v5.3.8), which needs to be installed and visible to your conda environment.
