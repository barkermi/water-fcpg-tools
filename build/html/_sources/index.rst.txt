Welcome to the StreamStats Flow Conditioned Parameter Grid (FCPG) Tools' documentation!
==============================================================================

This package provides python functions for converting a gridded parameter dataset, such as precipitation, to a grid where each grid cell is the upstream average value of the input grid. This is done by conditioning the input parameter grid using a flow direction grid, usually computed from a digital elevation model.

Much of the functionality in these tools is built around using the `USGS National Hydrography High-Resolution dataset <https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution>`_ (10 m, tiled by four-digit hydroligic units).
